Title: Auto-Mpg Data

Source: This dataset was taken from the StatLib library which is maintained at Carnegie Mellon University.The dataset was used in the 1983 American Statistical Association Exposition

Relevant information: The data concerns city-fuel consumption in miles per gallon,to be predicted in terms of 3 multivariate discrete and 5 continuous attributes.The number of instances are 398 and the number of attributes are 9 including the class attribute.The attribute information are:

* mpg - Milieage/Miles Per Galon
* cylinders - the power unit of the car where gasoline is turned into power
* displacement - engine displacement of the car
* horsepower - rate of the engine performance
* weight - the weight of a car
* acceleration - the acceleration of a car
* model - model of the car
* origin - the origin of the car
* car - the name of the car
